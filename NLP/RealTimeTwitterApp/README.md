# RealTimeTwitterApp

## Shiny app - real-time tweets analysis and visualisation

App created in 2018

### What people think?

Sometimes it is good to have a bigger picture and to not rely on information from only one source. What if we could in a
moment get to know what people think about certain topic around the world? Anger or Fear? If they see some topic as a
positive or a negative issue? What is the topic associated with? With which emotions people react?

### About the app

The app connects to Twitter's API and using text mining, natural language processing (NLP), Machine Learning and
visualisation analyses recent Tweets (in English) about the topic you choose. The analysis doesn't include retweets.
